## Hola 👋


**About Me**

<img align="right" width="450" height="600" src="https://github.com/mmd613/MMD613/blob/main/IMG_6273.JPG">
I am a **program evaluator and strategic researcher** with over 7 years of experience spanning public health, education, academia, and nonprofit sectors. I completed my PhD in Sociology at Rutgers-New Brunswick, having performed a multi-sited research study across two states on migrant integration, racial and class stratification, and urban development. My work consistently bridges **evaluation research, systems design, and stakeholder engagement** to deliver applicable solutions that enhance performance, mitigate risk, user engagement, and support mission-aligned outcomes. I am also passionate about community-centered research, having worked for small, local organizations looking to evaluate their programs and use data to inform mission and strategy. I am an avid gardener 🌱, baker 🥖, photographer 📸, and weightlifter 🏋. You can easily find me camping with my pup 🏕️🐶 <br>
