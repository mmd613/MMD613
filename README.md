## Hola 👋


**About Me**

I am a program evaluator and strategic researcher with over 7 years of experience spanning public health, education, academia, and nonprofit sectors. I completed my PhD in Sociology at Rutgers-New Brunswick, having performed a multi-sited research study across two states on migrant integration, racial and class stratification, and urban development. My work consistently bridges research, systems design, and stakeholder engagement to deliver applicable solutions that enhance performance, mitigate risk, user engagement, and support mission-aligned outcomes. I am also passionate about community-centered research, having worked for small, local organizations looking to evaluate their programs and use data to inform mission and strategy. I am an avid gardener 🌱, baker 🥖, and weightlifter 🏋. You can easily find me camping with my pup 🏕️🐶
